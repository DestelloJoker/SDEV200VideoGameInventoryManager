You must have Intellij or some IDE that is configured to run both mySQL, and javaFX; If you don't the program will fail to work properly.

This program uses both javaFX and mySQL to make a program that connects this GUI to a SQL database by changing the final Strings of DB_URL, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD in DBUtil.java, you'll also need to change the lines at 37,60,75, and 102 to be named as your table inside the schema you are using, for my table it was called inventory. Your schema name will already be inside the URL so as long as the schema name in the URL is correct, the DB will work correctly. 

There will be screenshots provided of my database table with items that have been added myself and randomly added through the random method made.
