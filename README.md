You must have Intellij or some IDE that is configured to run both mySQL, and javaFX; If you don't the program will fail to work properly.

This program uses both javaFX and mySQL to make a program that connects this GUI to a SQL database by changing the final Strings of DB_URL, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD in DBUtil.java, you'll also need to change the lines at 37,60,75, and 102 to be named as your schema.table that you're using (for my database schema and table it was videogameinventoryschema.inventory) if that doesn't work, change it to just be the table you wish to add items to. (Again for me it was just inventory)

There will be screenshots provided of my database table with items that have been added myself and randomly added through the random method made.
